    "#Flask is a popular web framework for building web applications using Python. It is a lightweight and modular framework that \n",
    "#is easy to use and provides flexibility for developers. Some of the advantages of using Flask are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#Lightweight: Flask is a lightweight framework that does not come with any pre-built components, allowing developers to choose\n",
    "#the components they need and avoiding any unnecessary bloat in their application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Easy to use: Flask is easy to learn and use, making it an excellent choice for beginners. It also has a simple and intuitive \n",
    "#API that allows developers to quickly build web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Flexible: Flask allows developers to customize and extend the framework according to their needs. It does not impose any \n",
    "#specific architecture or directory structure, giving developers more freedom in building their applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Built-in development server: Flask comes with a built-in development server, making it easy to test and debug applications \n",
    "#without the need for additional tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Large community: Flask has a large community of developers who contribute to the framework's development and provide support\n",
    "#to other developers. This community provides a wealth of resources, such as plugins, extensions, and documentation, that can\n",
    "#help developers to build applications more quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Overall, Flask is a powerful framework that is easy to use, flexible, and customizable. It is an excellent choice for building\n",

    "#Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "#App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to functions in a Flask application. When a user makes a request\n",
    "#to a URL in a Flask application, Flask uses the app routing mechanism to determine which function should be executed to handle\n",
    "#the request.\n",
    "\n",
    "#App routes are essential in Flask because they enable developers to create multiple pages or endpoints for their web application.\n",
    "#Each app route defines a unique URL, and when a user visits that URL, Flask calls the function that is associated with the\n",
    "#route to generate the HTML content to be displayed on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "#For example, consider a Flask application that has two pages, one to display a login form and another to display the user's \n",
    "#profile information. In this case, the login page might have the URL '/login', and the profile page might have the URL '/profile'.\n",
    "#By using app routes, the developer can define functions that will handle requests made to these URLs, making it easy to manage\n",
    "#the logic for each page in a separate function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#App routes can also be used to define dynamic URLs that can accept parameters, such as user IDs or product names. By using \n",
    "#dynamic routes, a developer can create a single function to handle requests to multiple URLs, reducing the amount of duplicated\n",
    "#code and making the application more maintainable.\n",
